# Simple surprise redirect

Open `index.html` in your browser. The page will automatically redirect after a few seconds (or immediately after clicking the button). The target URL is base64-encoded in the file so it isn't shown directly.

Quick test (in the project folder) with a local server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open in your browser: http://localhost:8000/index.html
```
